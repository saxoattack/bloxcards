# The Blox Cards Documentation

The General Card Effect Syntax
General case (single effect):

Effect = {
	Name
	Description
	Type
	Power
	Target
	Increase
}

The game executes the single effect as you would expect.

Sub-Effect case (multiple effects):

Effect = {
	Name
	Description
	Type
	Power = {
		{Power2, Increase2, Target2}
	}
	Target1
	Increase1
}

In the event of subeffects, game will first look for a secondary 
target or increase. Should it not be able to find such secondary 
values, it will fall back to the primary one. Should there be no 
primary one but the effect does require it, the game crashes. 
Make sure all effects get the info they need to function.

For example, the following effect uses Target1 for its subeffect.
Effect = {
	Power = {
		{Power2, Increase2}
	}
	Target1
	Increase1
}

This one uses Target2 but Increase1 for its subeffect.
Effect = {
	Power = {
		{Power2, nil, Target2}
	}
	Target1
	Increase1
}
